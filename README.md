I´m a financial data scientist in constant beta. I love to learn, research and code. My passion is to develop algorithmic trading systems.

During my career I´ve had different roles such as DataOps, MLOps and DevOps. However, the most important thing I´ve learnt in this time has been the value of:

* 🏅 Highly cooperative environments.
* 🎯 Peer review.
* 💪🏻 Co-specialization.
* 👨‍🔬 Empirical falsification.

In the last 11 years I've tested multiple Machine Trading approaches, here a sample.

* *Currently*, I´m working on:
  * **Cooperative multi-agent** trading systems.  
  * Basket **optimization** ML algorithms for non-supervised portfolio construction.
  * **Transformers with metalabeling architectures** and sampled multi-period market data.
  * Model-based environments for **limit order book**.
  
* *Previously*, other areas of researching:
  * **DRL** agents such as A2C, POO, TD3... for portfolio allocation (explainable DRL).
  * **DL** models such as LSTM, GRU, RNN... for multi-horizon forecasting.
  * **NLP** models such as BERT, RoBERTa, FinBert... for news-based event driven trading.
  * Other **ML** stuff: Multi-graph tensor networks, dual-process meta-learning, multi-head attention for TS... and a long list.

<h2>🤝 Let´s team up! </h2>

Would you like to join a **descentralized quant team**? We work as a cooperative research lab structure. If you are interested, __reach me!__  

We are also **open to collaborate** with other quant teams. It will be exciting to try to solve the markets together.
